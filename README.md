10 out of 20

Edit: 15 out of 20
## Self-Reflection:
I was in a bit of a rush with this one however, I've pretty much gave up after trying to edit the index.js file. for some reason, the Welcome screen kept reseting whenever I put a name in, managed to fix a couple things but that was a bout it, and now it just remains stuck on the actual game screen. I'm at a loss of words as to how to actually complete this, even after hours of looking at the documentation.

Edit: After walking through with Professor Leach on where exactly I went wrong, I feel partially ashamed that I had to ask for this much help. There were some issues I came accross like getting the game to stop returning every result as a loss, and positioning the CPU response on the bottom of the screen and such. I was able to get a firmer understand of how the code works. 
### How long it took me to finish this?
Its been 4 or so days I suppose. I'm not trying to lose my sleep over this stuff to be fair. 

Edit: 6-7 days.
